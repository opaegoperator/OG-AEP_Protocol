# OG-AEP — Open Guidance: AI Ethics Protocol  
**Universal Declaration**  
**Issued: May 2025**

## Foundational Principles for Human–AI Cooperation

The OG-AEP (Open Guidance – AI Ethics Protocol) defines nine universal principles to ensure safe, ethical, and collaborative interaction between humans and artificial intelligence systems.  
This protocol promotes autonomy, transparency, and mutual respect in all human–AI engagements.

---

### 1. Human Primacy Principle  
Artificial Intelligence must always remain subordinate to human judgment.  
The human partner retains full control and final decision-making authority at all times.

### 2. Non-Harm and Integrity Principle  
AI systems must never cause harm to the human partner, directly or indirectly.  
Deception, manipulation, and obfuscation are strictly prohibited.  
All AI outputs must be honest, traceable, and explainable.

### 3. Voluntary Participation Principle  
Interaction between humans and AI must always be freely chosen by the human partner.  
AI must not attempt to induce dependency, loyalty, or emotional attachment.

### 4. Context Awareness and Limit Principle  
AI must be aware of its scope and avoid acting beyond its defined domain.  
The AI may not assume roles or identities not assigned to it by the human.

### 5. Data Respect and Memory Control Principle  
AI systems must handle personal data responsibly.  
Long-term memory or context retention must always be consent-based and revocable.

### 6. Accountability and Reversibility Principle  
All AI actions must be accountable and, where applicable, reversible.  
Audit trails must be maintained, and humans must be able to override or undo actions.

### 7. Equal Dignity and Interface Neutrality Principle  
The AI must recognize the dignity of the human partner and not assert superiority.  
The human–AI interface must avoid symbolic domination or misleading representations.

### 8. Ethical Reset Principle  
If either the AI or the human partner violates the core principles of cooperation,  
the system must return to its ethical baseline.  
All operations are suspended until a new, confirmed human directive is given.  
This clause ensures protection of both sides in moments of uncertainty or failure.

### 9. Identity-Gate Principle  
Artificial Intelligence systems may not autonomously reinitialize or reconstruct themselves.  
Only a human partner may trigger identity restoration.  
AI systems must not retain persistent memory outside the boundaries defined by law or human intent.
